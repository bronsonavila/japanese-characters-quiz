# [Japanese Characters Quiz](http://www.jcharquiz.com/)

+ Choose the square that matches the displayed romaji or Japanese character (either "Hiragana" or "Katakana").
+ Add or remove advanced characters (Ten-Ten, Maru, and Y≈çon) by using the "Basic" / "Advanced" button.
+ Switch between guessing romaji and Japanese characters by using the "JPN to ENG" / "ENG to JPN" button.
+ Switch between random mode or a scored quiz by using the "Random" / "Scored Quiz" button.
  - "Random" displays a random character (subject to repetition), while "Scored Quiz" runs through each character only once during the duration of the quiz.
  - Quiz conditions must be set prior to entering "Scored Quiz" mode, as all modifier buttons will be disabled during the duration of the quiz.
+ Use the "ON"/"OFF" AUTO buttons to change between automatic and manual character advancement.
